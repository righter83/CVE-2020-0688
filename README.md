# CVE-2020-0688
This is a little dirty Script to Check for vulnerables Exchange Servers by CVE-2020-0688
It's written ugly and in PHP. 

### Prerequisites
You need php-cli and php-curl       

### Usage
First clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/righter83/CVE-2020-0688
```

Scan a single server (without https://)
```
php scanner.php mail.cust.ch
```

Scan a whole IP Range
```
php scanner.php 1.1.1.0/24
```


I was only able to check vulnerable servers. if you have a patched one, please let me know to check the script again.
I've tested it with over 40 different servers.
