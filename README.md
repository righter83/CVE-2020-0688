# CVE-2020-0688
This is a little Script to Check for Vulnerables Exchange Servers for the CVE-2020-0688

It's written ugly and in PHP. You need php-cli and php-curl to run

How to use it:
git clone https://github.com/righter83/CVE-2020-0688

run for single server (without https://)
php scanner.php mail.cust.ch

for a whole range
php scanner.php 1.1.1.0/24

I was only able to check vulnerable servers. if you have a patched one, please let me know to check the script again.
